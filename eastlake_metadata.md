# Eastlake Database Metadata

## Business Context

Eastlake is a fictitious B2B company that manufactures and sells products to businesses worldwide. The database contains transactional data including customers, orders, products, employees, and suppliers spanning from 2019 to 2026.

## Query Tips

**Important**: Don't assume all products are categorized or that similar INNER JOINs will always include all data. Some products may have NULL category_id values, and using INNER JOIN on categories will exclude these uncategorized products. Consider using LEFT JOIN when you need complete product listings.

**Date Ranges**: If no date range is specified, always include orders up to the current date, defined by `today()` in DuckDB. Do not include orders after the current date.

**Maps**: When rendering maps in generated HTML, always use OpenStreetMap (via Leaflet.js) or a similar free mapping service. Do not use Google Maps or other services that require API keys.

## Key Relationships

```
customers.customer_id <-- orders.customer_id (NOTE: orders.customer_id has embedded quotes)
employees.employee_id <-- orders.employee_id
orders.order_id <-- order_details.order_id (order_details.order_id is VARCHAR)
products.product_id <-- order_details.product_id (order_details.product_id is VARCHAR)
categories.category_id <-- products.category_id
suppliers.supplier_id <-- products.supplier_id
shippers.shipper_id <-- orders.ship_via
regions.region_id <-- territories.region_id
territories.territory_id <-- employee_territories.territory_id
employees.employee_id <-- employee_territories.employee_id
```

### Important Join Notes

The `orders.customer_id` column stores values with embedded quotes (e.g., `"WZQHE"`). To join with customers:
```sql
JOIN customers c ON REPLACE(o.customer_id, '"', '') = c.customer_id
```

The `order_details.order_id` and `order_details.product_id` are stored as VARCHAR/JSON. To join:
```sql
JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = CAST(od.order_id AS BIGINT)
JOIN products p ON CAST(p.product_id AS VARCHAR) = od.product_id
```

## Common Query Patterns

### Product Performance
```sql
SELECT
  p.product_name,
  c.category_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT od.order_id) as order_count,
  SUM(od.quantity) as total_quantity,
  SUM(od.unit_price * od.quantity * (1 - od.discount)) as revenue
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
LEFT JOIN order_details od ON CAST(p.product_id AS VARCHAR) = od.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name, c.category_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
```

### Customer Analysis
```sql
SELECT
  c.company_name,
  c.country,
  COUNT(DISTINCT od.product_id) as product_variety,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON REPLACE(c.customer_id, '"', '') = REPLACE(o.customer_id, '"', '')
JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = CAST(od.order_id AS BIGINT)
GROUP BY c.company_name, c.country
ORDER BY product_variety DESC
```

### Sales by Geography
```sql
SELECT
  c.country,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count,
  SUM(o.freight) as total_freight,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) as customer_count
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON REPLACE(c.customer_id, '"', '') = REPLACE(o.customer_id, '"', '')
GROUP BY c.country
ORDER BY order_count DESC
```
